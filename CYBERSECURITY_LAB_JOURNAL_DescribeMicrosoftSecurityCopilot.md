A log of Information Technology & Cybersecurity labs completed by Tyler Rivas, demonstrating acquired skills and practical experience.

**Lab Title:**  Describe Microsoft Security Copilot
**Platform/Provider:**  Microsoft Learn
**Date Completed:**  10/27/25
**Objectives:**  
- Explain the purpose and architecture of Microsoft Security Copilot.
- Define key terminology used in Copilot workflows.
- Analyze how Copilot processes prompt requests and integrates with Defender and Entra ID.
- Identify the four elements of an effective prompt.
- Review installation and configuration steps for Security Copilot.

**Summary of Activities:**
- Reviewed module content including videos and diagrams.
- Practiced writing prompts using the four-element framework.
- Explored integration points between Copilot and Defender XDR.
- Completed assessment with a score of 89% on first attempt.

**Skills/Tools Used:** 
I now understand how SCUs affect Azure billing and how workspace-level role permissions in Entra ID ensure secure access control. This knowledge is directly applicable to configuring Copilot in enterprise environments. I also gained insight into prompt engineering for AI-driven security workflowsâ€”an emerging skill in modern SOC operations.

**Reflection:**  
I learned how Azure is billed based on provisioned Security Compute Units (SCU). I learned how Security copilot integrates with entra ID to setup access to Role permissions and are configured per workspace to ensure users have appropriate access. I learned some of the essential terminology and vocabulary involving Microsoft security products. And lastly, learned how security copilot processes cloud based AI prompts.
